# PROMPT

Use the following template to document any script. The goal is to create a comprehensive yet accessible document that effectively communicates the purpose and workings of the code to both technical and non-technical audiences. Focus on clarity and simplicity.

# Documentation for [Script Name]

## 1. Brief Explanation of the Code
[Provide a high-level overview of the script. Explain what it does in simple terms, its main purpose, and what problem it solves. Avoid technical jargon as much as possible.]

## 2. Detailed Breakdown of Each Part of the Code
[Divide the script into logical sections and explain each section in detail. Use clear and concise language. Explain the function of each segment of the code in a step-by-step manner. If there are complex algorithms or logic, explain them in a way that a non-technical person can understand the general idea.]

### Section 1: [Code Segment Title]
[Explain the function of this specific segment of the code.]

### Section 2: [Code Segment Title]
[Explain the function of this specific segment of the code.]

... (Add more sections as needed)

## 3. Inputs Used
[Describe all the inputs the script uses. This could be command-line arguments, configuration files, user input, data files, etc. For each input, specify its name, type, description, any constraints, and where it comes from.]

| Input Name | Type | Description | Constraints | Source |
|------------|------|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| [Input 1]  | [Type] | [Description] | [Constraints] | [Source] |
| [Input 2]  | [Type] | [Description] | [Constraints] | [Source] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## 4. Outputs Generated
[Describe all the outputs the script produces. This could be files, data printed to the console, changes to a database, etc. For each output, specify its name, type, description, any conditions under which it is generated, and where it is stored or displayed.]

| Output Name | Type | Description | Conditions | Destination |
|-------------|------|-------------|------------|-----------------------|
| [Output 1]  | [Type] | [Description] | [Conditions] | [Destination] |
| [Output 2]  | [Type] | [Description] | [Conditions] | [Destination] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## 5. Final Summary
[Summarize the key points of the script in layman's terms. Emphasize the importance of the script and its overall function. Explain how the script helps the user or solves a problem. Avoid technical terms and focus on the practical benefits.]

**Instructions:**

1.  **Replace Placeholders:** Replace the bracketed placeholders (e.g., `[Script Name]`, `[Code Segment Title]`, `[Input 1]`, etc.) with the specific details of your script.
2.  **Clarity is Key:** Write in clear, concise, and simple language. Avoid technical jargon as much as possible. If technical terms are necessary, explain them in a way that a non-technical person can understand.
3.  **Logical Order:** Explain the code in a logical order, following the flow of execution.
4.  **Comprehensive:** Ensure that all necessary information is included, covering all aspects of the script.
5.  **Focus on Purpose:** Emphasize the purpose and practical benefits of the script.
6.  **Markdown Format:** Use Markdown formatting for readability.
7.  **Adapt as Needed:** Feel free to adapt the template to better suit the specific needs of your script, but ensure that all the core information is covered.

This generalized template should provide a solid foundation for documenting a wide variety of scripts, making them understandable to a broad audience. Remember to prioritize clarity and simplicity in your explanations.
Never add any code, given that the explanation is addressed to non technical people
